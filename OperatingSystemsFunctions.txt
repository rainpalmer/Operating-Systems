Operating systems Functions

Providing a user interface:
An operating system must have a user interface in order to allow a user to do anything on a computer. 
There are graphical user interfaces which use graphics and pictures to allow users to click icons to complete tasks on a computer.
There are also Command line interfaces that allow users to enter commands to complete tasks on a computer.
For this, exact spelling and punctuation is required. 

Managing programs:
Operating systems can do either a single task or they can multitask.
A single task operating system allows one program to run at a time.
A multitasking operating system can run multiple programs at a time. This is what most operating systems are nowadays. 
Multitasking operating systems can have one program in the foreground at a time, but can have many programs running in the background at a time. Running many programs at once can slow your coputer down significantly.

Managing memory:
Operating systems manage memory to optimize the use of RAM storage. 
They can assign data and instructions to certain areas of memory.
Once the data and instructions are finished processing the operating system will release them from memory.
A user can also use virtual memory as additional RAM if necessary. This may make your computer slow down because virtual memory is slower than RAM.
